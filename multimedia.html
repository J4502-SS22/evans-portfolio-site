<h2>Faces of the ICCM</h2>
<p>Though Muslims may sometimes be stereotyped as a homogenous group of only Arabs, in reality Islam is a diverse religion. This diversity is reflected through the many women who practice at the Islamic Center of Central Missouri, who have different backgrounds and experiences as Muslim women.
  <br><br>These women were photographed during the evening prayer, or Isha, on the first night of Ramadan on May 5, 2019.</p>

      <p class="caption" onclick="currentSlide(1)">Women and young girls pray in the masjid of the Islamic Center of Central Missouri in Columbia, Mo., on May 5, 2019. Among these women was Sohalia Bakr, an international student who came to MU three years prior from Egypt. "In Egypt, there is a hug number of Muslims, so you take Islam for granted more than here," she said. "You try to hold onto your religion and onto your identity more because not everyone is like you, so you get closer to your religion and closer to the community"</p>
      <p class="caption" onclick="currentSlide(2)">Humera Lodhi poses for a portrait during the Isha prayer at the Islamic Center of Central Missouri on May 5, 2019. Lodhi has veen practicing at the ICCM since she and her family moved to Columbia around 20 years ago. "There have been really beautiful times when I've seen the greater Columbia community really support the mosque," Lodhi said. "Of course, there are always off times when you're walking down the street and you might get stares or comments, so that's really hard."</p>
      <p class="caption" onclick="currentSlide(3)">Rana Jasin reads the Quran while her daughter Mina Saadi sits next to her at the Islamic Center of Central Missouri on May 5, 2019. With recent violence against Islamic places of worship, Jasin said she is usually afraid to bring her children to the ICCM, but he daughter loves to come along with her. "Coming here, I feel like I'm myself more," Saadi said. "Whenever I'm going through a tough time, I can just pray and hope that there won't be tough times anymore."</p>
      <p class="caption" onclick="currentSlide(4)">Zainab Almustapha poses for a portrait after the Isha prayer at the Islamic Center of Central Missouri on May 5, 2019.
