    <h2>Chamois farming team takes on hemp cultivation and learns by doing</h2>
    <h3>Publish date: Dec. 30, 2021. Co-authored with Bolette Elsoee</h3>
    <p>It all started with a few too many beers. One late night, good friends Sean Hackmann and Scott Mertz percolated an idea: growing and selling hemp.
      <br><br>Initially they thought about medical marijuana, but they soon realized hemp was easier to get started. That same night, they came up with the company name, Grandpas Family Farms — and a hemp adventure took off.
      <br><br>Today, Grandpas Family Farms in Chamois sells its products in gas stations, supermarkets and CBD stores.
      <br><br>All of the products contain cannabidiol, or CBD, which is claimed to have an array of health benefits, including pain relief, cures for hangovers and migraines, and alleviation of anxiety and stress. The products range from CBD oil, gummies, flowers and joints to massage oil and lotion.
      <br><br>However, the effects of CBD have not yet been scientifically proven, according to the FDA, and studies are still assessing the side effects. But Mertz and Hackmann say they are certain CBD products help people.
      <br><br>They have collected anecdotes from customers who say they have experienced less anxiety or were able to stop taking prescription medication after using CBD oil.
      <br><br>“We have a lot of people that have bad migraines,” Mertz said, “and when that’s onsetting, they smoke this, and they say it never even hits them.”
      <br><br>“Unfortunately, we can’t claim any medical benefits because the FDA hasn’t gotten involved yet,” he said. “So, it’s considered more like a supplement right now.”</p>
    <h4>Lessons learned</h4>
    <p>Grandpas Family Farms completed its harvest this fall, and its first two years in the hemp business have involved both challenges and successes.
      <br><br>Since hemp cultivation is a relatively new and growing industry, “there’s no book that says this is how you grow the plant,” especially for outdoor growers like Grandpas Family Farms, Hackmann said.
      <br><br>Both Hackmann and Mertz have agriculture backgrounds, with generations of farmers in their families. They also farm corn and soybeans, which allowed them to enter the hemp industry with knowledge and plenty of equipment.
      <br><br>But there was still a lot to learn — and a lot of expenses along the way.
      <br><br>Hackmann and Mertz estimate they have spent at least $500,000 to enter the hemp cultivation industry, and that’s without having to buy new tractors and planters. The pair said their greenhouse cost about $200,000 to build, and their main warehouse cost around $100,000.
      <br><br>Last year, they grew hemp on 13 acres at three different locations, testing the soil to find the best. This year, they consolidated the operation to 6 acres in the location that yielded the top results.
      <br><br>“We’re gonna have more out of those 6 acres than we had last year for sure,” Hackmann said. “We just learned a lot on how to grow.”
      <br><br>They encountered two major issues while growing: humidity and pests.
      <br><br>In Missouri, humidity can cause mold. Harvesting the plant can’t happen too late or mold is likely. It’s an issue the nation’s hubs of hemp cultivation and information — Oregon and Colorado — don’t experience as much.
      <br><br>As for bugs, armyworms are a big threat the plants are facing. If left unchecked, they can burrow into the bud and defecate. Aside from being unappealing, that also makes the plant more likely to mold. Residual pesticides weren’t an option, but the two growers were able to find an organic product to deal with the pests.
      <br><br>Besides these two problems, the team has also learned how to innovate to make hemp cultivation easier and more effective.
      <br><br>At first, they hung the plants during the drying process, but this proved long and inefficient. After making their own custom drying racks, they significantly cut the time it takes to process the hemp after it’s harvested.
      <br><br>Another innovation is their deleafing machine, which the two growers hope to patent.
      <br><br>It is an angled tube with differently sized grates for the hemp to pass through that the team finds more effective than the alternatives on the market.</p>
    <h4>Legal barriers</h4>
    <p>Growing commercial hemp is uncharted territory. When the 2018 Farm Bill was signed, a new industry was born. The hemp industry was launched in Missouri in January 2020. Applications could then be accepted from prospective growers, such as Grandpas Family Farms.
      <br><br>Today Missouri has 207 producers cultivating 811 acres of hemp. Eighty percent of the crop is intended for floral use, as it is on Grandpas Family Farms.
      <br><br>The application fee cost Mertz and Hackmann $750, and they could not have any controlled substance-related felonies in the last 10 years. Compared to marijuana operations that are heavily regulated, only a few barriers to entry exist for hemp farms: An unlimited number of licenses are available, and there are no size requirements for hemp production or security regulations for fencing, cameras or signage.
      <br><br>For the hemp products to be legal, however, they cannot contain more than 0.3% of THC. Above that percentage, a product is considered marijuana and can produce a “high.”
      <br><br>Before hemp farmers can harvest a crop, they must send a sample to be tested through the Missouri Department of Agriculture for the amount of THC. If they meet the THC requirement, they have 30 days to harvest the hemp.</p>
    <h4>From seed to harvest</h4>
    <p>At Grandpas Family Farms, plants start their life cycle in a greenhouse, growing from seeds to seedlings in a controlled environment. After about four weeks of growth, a four-person team riding a planter drops the seedlings into holes on the farm’s 6 acres, with two others walking behind to plant the spots that were missed.
      <br><br>“We did all 6 acres in what, about six hours?” Mertz asked.
      <br><br>“Yeah, it was efficient,” Hackmann said.
      <br><br>The plants grow outside from spring to harvest — mid-June to October — when they are harvested by hand during one of the busiest times of the season.
      <br><br>To help with the heavy workload, the team gets help from the Chamois community. The local high school students “love getting their hands sticky,” Hackmann said.
      <br><br>Handling the hemp requires gloves to keep one’s hands from getting too messy. Also, the smell lingers.
      <br><br>“It takes months for it to get out of your dryer,” Mertz said.
      <br><br>“Vehicles especially,” Hackmann said. “You get pulled over sometimes, and we’re just like, ‘Hey, it’s gonna smell like hemp in here’ right up front.”
      <br><br>Once the harvest is complete, the plants are destemmed, dried, cured in tubs for added flavor and potency, deleafed, cured again, then trimmed. After that it is made into various products.
      <br><br>Now that Missouri has legalized medical marijuana, Mertz and Hackmann hope legislators will open the door for recreational use, as well. Grandpas Family Farms has all the facilities, knowledge and equipment to expand, a move that would mean big business for a small Chamois-based company.

    <h2>MU goes online because of COVID-19 concerns</h2>
    <h3>Publish date: March 11, 2020. Co-authored with Hunter Gilbert.</h3>
    <p>MU will cancel classes Thursday through Sunday, Chancellor Alexander Cartwright announced in an email. Next week, all classes will be held remotely at their regular times.
      <br><br>In-person classes will resume March 30, the Monday after spring break.
      <br><br>Faculty and staff are expected to report to work for the rest of this week and all of next week.
      <br><br>MU-related travel has been heavily curtailed. According to the email:
      <ul><li>All university related nonessential international and domestic travel is suspended until April 12, including previously approved travel.</li>
        <li>This includes travel connected to university activities or programs for all faculty, staff and students, whether that travel is funded by the university, an external grant or any other sources.</li>
        <li>Requests to engage in essential travel must be approved by deans, vice chancellors or vice provosts.</li>
        <li>All nonessential university events will be canceled until March 29. “Necessary small meetings and athletic events,” however, will continue.</li></ul>
      MU will continue to be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected, according to the email.
      <br><br>As of Wednesday, there were no known cases of the novel coronavirus at MU.
      <br><br>The decisions announced late Wednesday afternoon were prompted by concerns about a group of MU journalism students and faculty members who attended a data journalism conference last weekend in New Orleans. Another of the attendees — who was not part of the MU group — tested “presumptive positive” for COVID-19.
      <br><br>The two dozen or so members of the MU group were told to stay home after the conference group, Investigative Reporters & Editors, posted an announcement about the presumptive positive result. The IRE statement said the person had mild symptoms and was expected to make a full recovery.
      <br><br>One of the students affected said MU Health Care Emergency Services is making screening and testing for the virus available to them Thursday.
      <br><br>Meanwhile, on Wednesday, the World Health Organization classified COVID-19 as a pandemic, meaning “a worldwide spread of new disease,” according to the organization’s website. According to a WHO news release, COVID-19 is the first pandemic to come from a coronavirus, which is a large family of viruses.
      <br><br>“Given the situation that we became aware of late on Tuesday, coupled with a lot of other factors, including the fact that WHO has declared this an official pandemic, and along with the fact that we now have the technology to go forward with putting these courses online and delivering the instruction remotely, we felt like we could make this decision,” MU spokesman Christian Basi said.
      <br><br>“Our plans have to be fluid,” Basi said. “We’re hoping for the best — in other words, hoping that we can go back to face-to-face classes. That is the plan after spring break. We will be prepared to do more if necessary.”
      <br><br>Cartwright’s email said: “We remain in touch with the Boone County Department of Public Health and Human Services and health experts at MU Health Care. These actions are consistent with those taken at other universities and industry around the country.”
      <br><br>Earlier Wednesday, as Basi answered questions about the journalism students, he addressed the potential for change in how the university functions day to day.
      <br><br>“I’ve never been in a situation where we’ve talked about the operations of the campus being disrupted for months,” he said.
      <br><br>The transition to classes taught remotely may be easier for some courses than for others, such as lab sciences or ensemble groups in the School of Music. For hands-on learning classes, the transition will likely be easier if in-person classes are suspended for a shorter period of time, Basi said.
      <br><br>“We may have to do some adjustments and be thinking very much outside of the box,” he said.
      <br><br>MU administrators are strongly discouraging personal international travel by students, faculty and staff during spring break — and other spring break travel generally. In an email to students Monday, Cartwright suggested students not travel over break or that they rework their itineraries.
      <br><br>“We do understand that students are going to be going home for spring break — that’s not what we’re talking about,” Basi said later. “We’re talking about travel to destinations other than students’ homes.”
      <br><br>MU is trying to determine a way to figure out where students do travel over spring break, Basi said, in case that place becomes a hot spot for the virus.
      <br><br>“It’s helpful for us to know that,” he said, “and helpful to know what the student’s family is doing to prevent the spread of the disease.”
      <br><br>Basi emphasized that the situation is moving quickly. The MU Alert website is the best and most complete source for campus updates on COVID-19. He recommended following MU on Twitter and that students carefully read emails from the university.
      <br><br>Colleges and universities across the country are also being forced to address COVID-19 concerns. Responses include short-term closures, moving classes online temporarily or for the rest of the academic year or closing down for the rest of the semester. Harvard University told its students on Tuesday to move out by Sunday.
      <br><br>After its list of colleges and universities closing because of COVID-19 reached 100 schools, the Chronicle of Higher Education said it stopped updating it.
      <br><br>Study-abroad programs have been hard-hit. Travel to South Korea and Italy — the top study-abroad spot for MU students — were canceled late last month. The Journalism School’s program in Barcelona, Spain, was canceled for this semester.
      <br><br>How students studying abroad are able to keep up with their credit requirements appears to be sorting out on a case-by-case basis. Basi said MU is working with host programs to help students get at least partial credit.
      <br><br>Basi said MU is also looking into partial and total refunds depending on the program. MU is working with third-party vendors, as well, regarding fees students paid upfront for certain trips — such as Marching Mizzou, whose members had a trip to Ireland canceled this week.
      <br><br>“We want our students to continue their academic progress,” Basi said, “and we also don’t want to have a burden placed on them in any shape or form.”
      <br><br>Columbia Public Schools will remain in session as usual, according to a letter to district families Wednesday evening. "We continue to monitor the situation and will keep you informed of any changes or additional information as it becomes available," the letter stated.
      <br><br>Superintendent Peter Stiepleman updated the Columbia School Board on Monday.
      <br><br>The district said that in light of MU's announcement, Adventure Club will continue to operate, changes to after-school activities will be made at the district level and after communication with schools and sponsors, and teachers are preparing in case alternative methods of teaching become necessary.
      <br><br>Students who have health needs that make them high-risk, or students with family members in the home who are high-risk, may work directly with their school nurse and guidance counselor to determine the best academic and educational plan, the letter stated.</p>

    <h2>Bob Humphreys ‘did whatever he could to help people’</h2>
    <h3>Publish date: March 30, 2020.</h3>
    <p>When John Robert "Bob" Humphreys was the general manager of the Missourian, he wasn't the typical boss of the era.
    <br><br>"He had a gentle way about him," Rick Wise, who worked for Mr. Humphreys after graduating from MU, said. "And I think he was so physically fit that he was very centered, and he was always calm."
    <br><br>"We're talking about the mid-70s," Wise went on. "Most guys thought you had to be a fire-breather to be a boss; you had to be intimidating and rough. And Bob was even-handed and fair and realistic. He wanted us to do our jobs, but he was a motivator instead of an intimidator."
    <br><br>Vicki Russell, the former publisher of the Columbia Daily Tribune, also reported directly to Mr. Humphreys while she was working at the Missourian as a graduate teaching assistant.
    <br><br>"It was the kind of energy and influence that young, just-getting-started journalists needed," Russell said.
    <br><br>Born Oct. 3, 1926, in Pennsylvania, Mr. Humphreys got his degree from MU in broadcast journalism after serving in the U.S. Army Air Corps in World War II. Mr. Humphreys and his wife, Freda Humphreys, moved to Oregon where he worked in the radio business for 20 years. There, the couple adopted their two sons, Kim and Steve.
    <br><br>After returning to MU to get his master's degree, Bob worked as the general manager for the Missourian from 1973 to 1987. He then became the chairperson of the advertising department until he retired in 1992.
    <br><br>Mr. Humphreys died Thursday, March 26, 2020.
    <br><br>"I really think at the end of the day he just wanted to help you," Steve Humphreys said. "He did whatever he could to help people. He did that with his adviser roles, and he did that with his mentoring different people. He wanted people to succeed."
    <br><br>Boone County Southern District Commissioner Fred Parry also worked with Bob at the Missourian.
    <br><br>"He was very positive, very energetic," Parry said. "I used to admire him because he’d never have a bad day. That was contagious for those of us who worked around him.”
    <br><br>Bob filled his days with exercise, helping others and love for his wife of 71 years.
    <br><br>"He always had a great smile," Steve Humphreys said. "He could turn on the charm. He was always very personable and a never-knew-a-stranger kind of guy, just very happy go lucky."
    <br><br>He loved to box when he was younger and to run and swim, Steve Humphreys said. When he moved to Missouri, Bob ran 8 miles every day, Kim Humphreys said.
    <br><br>"Running meant a lot, and I think that helped him think and kind of keep everything straight in his head," Kim Humphreys said.
    <br><br>After Bob's retirement, he continued to help people through his volunteer work. He was a volunteer for the Columbia Park Patrol to maintain the MKT Nature and Fitness Trail. He also volunteered at the Cedar Creek Therapeutic Riding Center and at The Wardrobe.
    <br><br>“Not only was he a great mentor to a lot of people over the years, but he was also a very generous soul and really just put humanity first," Parry said. "I think that Bob just did a great job of really setting an example for others to follow.”
    <br><br>Kim Humphreys remembered his father's penchant for helping others would manifest in different ways, like in helping his bank teller get a job in advertising or in the friendly way he interacted with those around him.
    <br><br>"It didn't matter if it was some garbage collector, or it could be the governor," Kim Humphreys said. "It didn't matter who it was; he was buddies with them.
    <br><br>"He just really had this unerring love for being around people and chatting with them and finding out about them and telling them about himself and just sharing his life with theirs and seeing where the intersections were," he added.
    <br><br>His wife, Freda, died earlier.
    <br><br>He is survived by two sons, Kimball and his wife, Shirley, and Stephen and his wife, Annette; and five grandchildren.
    <br><br>A memorial service at Calvary Episcopal Church and a celebration of life are pending.</p>

    <h2>Sinquefield Music Center opens, creating opportunities for MU composers</h2>
    <h3>Publish date: Feb. 2, 2020.</h3>
    <p>The crowd at the Sinquefield Music Center on Saturday morning was silent as the faculty quintet Mizzou Brass played “Fanfare,” written for the center's grand opening by MU senior Ben Rouder.
    <br><br>The $24 million building at University Avenue and Hitt Street is just down the road from the Fine Arts Building where part of the music school remains. Attendees filled the 140 seats set up in the Instrumental Rehearsal Room, some standing in the back once the chairs were taken.
    <br><br>When "Fanfare" ended, listeners erupted into more than 20 seconds of applause as the composer and the players stood. The piece was fitting — the building was designed as part of the Mizzou New Music Initiative, which Jeanne and Rex Sinquefield began in 2009 to focus on composition.
    <br><br>“It’s magical when you sit there and realize this piece of music wouldn’t have been written,” donor Jeanne Sinquefield said of Rouder’s piece and the initiative that led to it.</p>
    <h4>‘Incredibly acoustically pliable’</h4>
    <p>Earlier in the week, David Myers, director of audio/visual services for the School of Music, pointed out some of his favorite features in the building he helped design.
      <br><br>The walls of the recording studio are lined with black absorbers and ScatterBox grids, or wooden acoustical devices used to diffuse sound. The ceiling is two stories high, and there are four adjustable curtains around the room.
      <br><br>It’s all for one purpose: to control the quality of sound in the room. That’s essential, Myers said, because only the music should come through. A high-quality studio is key to recording new music being created at the school.
      <br><br>“This room is incredibly acoustically pliable, so you can have a room like this where all the curtains are open, and you can have some reverb,” Myers said. He clapped his hands, and a tiny echo followed. “Like it kind of lasts in the room.”
      <br><br>Myers walked over to a pulley system controlling the curtains.
      <br><br>“But if we pull the curtains like this” — he closed one set of curtains, then another — “now the room is different.”
      <br><br>Next, Myers showcased the recording studio’s isolation rooms.
      <br><br>“The idea is that we could have instrumentalists or singers or whoever in these two spaces while there’s loud stuff going on out here,” Myers said, referring to the larger studio. “It completely isolates them. So, you can record full bands at a time and just use this whole space.”
      <br><br>These aren’t the only methods of controlling sound quality in the recording studio. A 6-inch slab of concrete lies under the wooden floor, which is floated above the concrete with neoprene pucks. Additionally, the studio walls are at an angle, making it as if the room is within another room, Myers said.
      <br><br>These measures isolate the studio from the rest of the building.
      <br><br>“The reason for that is that there’s a giant band room over there, and then the concert hall is right around the corner,” Myers said. “If all that sound is bleeding into here, then it’ll ruin your recording and vice versa. So, when we’re banging on the rock band in here and they’re trying to have a piano recital next door, they don’t want to hear each other.”
      <br><br>Myers was also excited about elements in the control room, including the Avid S4 console. “There’s only a handful of them that I know of in the country,” he said. “It’s a mixing console with all the faders and knobs and everything.”</p>
    <h4>So long, MU’s 'seventh column'</h4>
    <p>The new rehearsal rooms have been designed to house large ensembles, with acoustical panels lining the walls, adjustable curtains, nearly three-story high ceilings and an acoustical shell hanging from the ceiling.
      <br><br>“Our large ensembles have never had acoustically designed spaces to rehearse in,” Julia Gaines, School of Music director and a percussion professor, said. “This may seem superfluous to an outsider, but rehearsing in a space where you can actually hear the rest of the ensemble is critical to achieving excellence in performance.”
      <br><br>The band’s old rehearsal space in Loeb Hall was a refurbished cafeteria, which meant low ceilings and a large pole that divided the room. Although the pole made it difficult to hear and see each other, the players made light of it — branding it MU’s “seventh column.”
      <br><br>“It was like a meme,” Jane Wang, a sophomore flute performance major, said. “People joked about it all the time.”
      <br><br>She also prefers the new building’s location.
      <br><br>“I’m mostly excited for the fact that we don’t have to walk to Loeb anymore, because Loeb is on the other side of campus, and I’m a weak person, and I’m always tired,” Wang said.
      <br><br>The School of Music will now be largely housed in two buildings rather than spread out across seven buildings.
      <br><br>Phase 2 of the music school’s expansion would add classrooms, faculty studios, smaller rehearsal rooms and a concert hall. The timeline and the funding for this is unclear.
      <br><br>Speakers at the event emphasized the importance of playing music in a space designed for that purpose.
      <br><br>“And certainly, the joy of life is in music, and that makes our lives boundless,” MU Chancellor Alexander Cartwright said. “And with this new music center, our extraordinary musicians will have the space and resources they need to create even more of the boundless joy for generations to come.
      <br><br>"Great scholars deserve great spaces," Cartwright said, "and that’s what this is.”</p>
