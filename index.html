  <h1>Laura Evans</h1>
  <p>Hello, my name is <strong>Laura Evans</strong>, and Iâ€™m a young scholar and journalist soon to be entering the job market after I graduate in May. I major in Data Journalism and Latin, with a passion for language and grammar.  I love all kinds of reporting, having some experience in education, business, and investigative reporting in particular. I also really enjoy editing, particularly copy editing, and I've been working at the Columbia Missourian as a copy editor for about 1.5 years. At MU, I've gotten to try my hand at a number of skills, like multimedia storytelling, design, data analysis, and even coding in service of journalism.<br>Interested? Any questions? <a href="mailto:lgevans@mail.missouri.edu?subject=Feedback">Shoot me a message!</a></p>
